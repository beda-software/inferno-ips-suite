      medications relevant for the scope of the patient summary.\r\nThe actual content
      could depend on the jurisdiction, it could report:\r\n- the currently active
      medications; \r\n- the current and past medications considered relevant by the
      authoring GP; \r\n- the patient prescriptions or dispensations automatically
      extracted by a regional or a national EHR.\r\n\r\nIn those cases medications
      are documented in the Patient Summary as medication statements or medication
      requests.\r\nThis section requires either an entry indicating the subject is
      known not to be on any relevant medication; either an entry indicating that
      no information is available about medications; or entries summarizing the subject's
      relevant medications."
